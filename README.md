# Shader Test Bed

This is an ongoing project.

I built this project to test out different shaders on various obj files, as well as practice my OpenGL and C# skills.

This project is built using OpenTK 3.3 and windows forms for the UI.

I plan to extend it with some interesting mesh processing effects or physics simulations (like deformations) in the future.
